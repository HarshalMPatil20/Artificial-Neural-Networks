# ```Neural Networks```

> Type of machine learning process that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain.

Neural networks are made up of **Interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that mimics the way biological neurons** signal to one another. They are a subset of machine learning and are at the core of deep learning algorithms
