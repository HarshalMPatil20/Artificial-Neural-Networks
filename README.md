# ```Artificial Neural Networks```

> Artificial Neural Networks are a branch of machine learning models that are built using principles of neuronal organization discovered by connectionism in the biological neural networks constituting animal brains.

Artificial Neural networks are made up of **Interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that mimics the way biological neurons** signal to one another. They are a subset of machine learning and are at the core of deep learning algorithms.
